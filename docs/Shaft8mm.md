## Dimensions

These drawing dimensions are in millimeters, and they are incomplete because the precise width of retaining grooves
will depend on the retaining clip used and also on what tools are available to cut those grooves. For the rocker and bogie
shafts, their end pieces can be as narrow as fabrication technique (and skill) permit, but 1-2mm is a good target range.

#### Wheel axle drive shaft

Make 6 copies, one for each wheel. The 9mm segment is for servo coupler and needs detent. The 22mm segment is
for a wheel, and the inside edge will be for the wheel hub and needs a detent.

#### Steering shaft

Make 4 copies, one for each corner. The 9mm segment is for servo coupler and needs detent. The 15mm segment is
for a steering knuckle and needs a detent at its center.
